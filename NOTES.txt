1. Events need consolidating
   Use a global NodeJS EventEmitter consistently
   Split event names / event state / global event instance

2. Custom scheme notifier should know nothing about event state or correlation
   It just fires events vis a global event emitter class

3. Deep link startup not working reliably on Windows 10
   Needs detailed testing in terms of React views invoked

4. Login and logout errors to reflect in hosted web pages
   Needs more failure testing

5. React main startup is messy
   Use async file reading and handle main process errors via console output
   Single place to express config file name
