1. Get basics working again with improved code

2. Deep link startup not working reliably on Windows 10
   Can I use setAsDefaultProtocol with extra parameters?
   If so test startup location renders correctly
   See if it is possible to use private uri schemes without a full rebuild
   Do detailed testing in terms of React views invoked

3. Login and logout errors to reflect in hosted web pages
   Needs more failure testing

4. React main startup needs improving
   Use async file reading and handle main process errors via console output
   Single place to set config file name
