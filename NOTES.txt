1. Get logins stable - currently second attempt does not do a Chrome custom scheme popup
   I have to completely quit Chrome and retry
   Compare with previous version to understand why

2. keytar problems: already exists / An invalid record was encountered
   Causes user info problems - is it trying to update concurrently?

3. Avoid creating my own codeVerifier
   Check response state is handled

4. Are there typings for any of these?
   * electron-default-menu
   * electron-packager
   * opener
   * username'

5. Reduce static members and refine code further
   Get latest tweaks to websample.final

6. Get logout working
