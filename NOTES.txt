1. Fix re-rendering and make flags clearer:
   isStarting
   isLoggedIn
   isSessionButtonsActive

2. Home button behaviour is not intuitive in login required view

3. Fix Desktop Sample 1 and React SPA

4. Update Android to use LogoutUrlBuilder

5. CustomSchemeNotifier as a global object is poor
   Redirect events related code needs improving
   Think about a folder for custom scheme notifications and events
